# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean. The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

l = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3]
n = len(l)
summ = sum(l)
mean = summ / n

print("The arithmetical mean is", str(mean))
print(l)


#2. Two Lowest Elements
#When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
#They can be equal to each other or different.
#Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3


list = [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2]
n = len(list)
list.sort()

print("two lowest element is " + str(list[0]) + ',' + ' ' + str(list[1]))
